"PDF Invoice Extractor pulls invoice data from your PDFs into Excel 
automatically.

Here's how it works:

Step 1: Open the app and click Browse to select your folder of PDF invoices.

Step 2: Click Start Extraction.

Step 3: Wait a few seconds while it processes each file.

Step 4: Done! Open your folder to find the Excel file with all your invoice 
data - invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and vendors - neatly organized in 
one spreadsheet.

Green means success. Yellow means some data was missing. Red means the file 
couldn't be processed - usually because it's a scanned image, not a digital PDF.

That's it. No setup. No technical skills needed. Just drag, click, and export."
